I wrote this library because I needed a TFTP server in my ATMOSphere program.
I'm releasing it along with it only because at hte moment is the only software
I created that use it, and so is for it.

I hope I'll have the time to fully implement also the client functions (now
that WriteSession's and ReadSession's are complete this should be really 
trivial.

Maybe one of the next days I'll broke this library in a new package and release
it also if ATMOSphere is not complete for now, but I'm not sure about it for now.

I licensed this library using the LGPL 2.1 because this is inline with KDE
standards and also because I think that an implementation of TFTP protocol in a
QT way can be useful.
See libtftp/COPYING file for license details.
