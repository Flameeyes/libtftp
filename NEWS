From version 0.1
 * Mapping method changed, now you should pass a QIODevice pointer to map
   the filename to an already opened QFile or to a QBuffer (useful to get
   logs for my ATMOSphere program).
 * Server and Client now emits two signals when file are completed to
   upload or download.
 * Sessions doesn't close and delete the QIODevice instances (old QFile
   instances), you should connect sentFile() and receivedFile() signals to
   some slots to delete the QIODevice instance.
